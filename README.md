# LG-TV-Cc
LGTV Companion companion. Helps make LGTV Companion work better when using a KVM and multiple PCs. This will enable and disable LGTVC management based on what devices are currently attached to your PC. Uses autohotkey (v2) functions to change states on device change by looking for specific Device ID(s).

In other words, LGTVC + this app will make your TV change input automatically based on which PC currently has your mouse and/or keyboard connected to it.

Run the compiled binary, or the autohotkey script, and configure the options from the settings menu (found in the system tray icon's menu).
